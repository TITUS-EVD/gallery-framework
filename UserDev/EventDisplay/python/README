# python components for TITUS event display

## Organization:

Event display consists of two base components:

- GUI base class which by default just makes an empty window and provides hooks for
different modules
- Gallery interface which reads events and outputs data from products

The link between these two comes from user-written modules. Modules have access
to some parts of the gui and also receive data from the gallery interface.

Data products inherit from a common drawable base class. These can access
properties of the modules like the module's view widget

To draw a new data product, start by implementing a C++ class for it, following the
gallery-framework examples in the parent directory. Then add python classes in the
gallery_interface/datatypes directory

To add a new view or interactive element, write a new class in the modules directory

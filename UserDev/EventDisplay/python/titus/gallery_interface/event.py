# This class exists as the basic interface for controlling events
# Defines a lot of functions but the final implementation needs to be done
# by a specific mode of running
# This base class is meant to provide information interface
# This class is also the manager for file interface, and contains the general functions.
# It needs to be extended independently for daq or reco viewing

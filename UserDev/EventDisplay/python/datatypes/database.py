# from ROOT import evd


# These classes provide the basic interfaces for drawing objects
# It's meant to be inherited from for specific instances
# There is a class for drawing the following things:
#   - Raw wire data
#   - hits
#   - clusters
#   - nothing else ... yet

# To add a class, what you have to do is write a module to process it (larlite ana_processor)
# Put your class in RecoViewer or wherever.  I use the namespace evd for all of these classes
# so if you use something else, be sure to import it above from ROOT

# Your class needs to include getter methods for the data you need, and a setProducer function
# which sets the producer of the data type.  Then, write a python class that inherits from
# recoBase below.  Your class must override the function drawObjects to display it's data
# on the views.  Your class is responsible for maintaining the items being drawn, and must
# clear them with the clearDrawnObjects function.  Store drawn objects in
# _drawnObjects.

# Lastly, extend the drawableItems class with one line:
# self._drawableClasses.update({'dataProduct':yourPythonClassName})
# This gives the viewer the connection between the class you made and the
# product you want to draw

# Beyond that, inside your larlite or python class you can do pretty much whatever you want
# Run merging, matching, ertool, who cares.
